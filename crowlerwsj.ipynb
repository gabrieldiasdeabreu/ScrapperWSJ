      "I was delighted to read Matthew Gurewitsch's review in which he gives high praise to tapestry and the expertise of weavers (\"How Painters Undermined Weavers' Uncommon Artistry,\" Leisure &amp; Arts, Dec. 13). He is inaccurate, however, in naming the structural unit in tapestry a \"stitch.\" Weaving is an interlacement of two elements, warp and weft. To identify this intersection of threads as a stitch is to perpetuate the mistaken notion that needle-worked textiles are tapestries. While both paintings and tapestries provide visual pleasure, only tapestries have the added value of texture which gives physical and perceived warmth to indoor space. Because the art form of tapestry, a technique that cannot be produced on any machine, meets many human needs, it is no wonder they \"were prized far above paintings.\"\n",

Interchange fees are necessary to fairly share the cost of an electronic payment system among the two key beneficiaries: cardholders and merchants.

The hope is that the first openly contested election for the head of the African National Congress will strengthen Africa's most successful democracy. So far the fear that the controversy would fuel the racial, tribal and political tensions and rend apart the fragile fabric of ANC unity has not materialized. But the recent government announcement that the ANC's new populist leader Jacob Zuma will be indicted on corruption charges may seriously test South Africa's young democracy. If the judiciary is seen as a political tool of the government, it will undermine the very strength that sets South Africa apart  --  the rule of law. These are trying times, and those who love South Africa can only trust that the spirit of Mandela will prevail and South African democracy will emerge all the stronger.\n",

We have a Democrat-controlled Congress with Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi at its helm enjoying a pathetic 11% approval rating nationwide and accomplishing absolutely nothing. If my kid came home from school with a record like that he'd be on bounds for life. And if Hillary with a disapproval rating of 49% is piled on top of Nancy and Harry, and they win the 2008 election, this country will have a divide of bitterness deeper than the Grand Canyon for a long time to come. The Republicans have been no better. Government and spending have risen without restraint, contrary to their basic principles. \"Earmarks\" are revered, making erstwhile loyalists abandon the party as simply a bunch of politicians whose only goal is to get re-elected. But either way, as Mr. Henninger writes, \"More than ever, the electorate is being ill-served, and knows it.\"\n",
